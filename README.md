# WeatherStationPico
A data-logging weather station that uses a LCD display for user output, a potentiometer for user input, a DS3231 real time clock module and the DFRobot Weather Station v3.

The weather station is currently very buggy, and do not expect top-quality code, as I have not had years of experience with writing code for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
